  - Optimized caching for different file types
  - Custom error responses
  - Origin Access Identity for secure S3 access

- **Infrastructure as Code** ⚡
  - Modular Terraform configuration
  - Easy to customize and extend
  - Follows AWS best practices
  - Cost-optimized design

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.2.0 or later) 🔧
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials 🔑
- An AWS account with permissions to create S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions 🏢

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitkumar-Github8/Smart-S3-Deployment.git
cd Smart-S3-Deployment
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials

Make sure your AWS credentials are configured:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format (json).

### 3. Customize the Configuration

Copy the example variables file and edit it with your settings:

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your deployment:

```hcl
# AWS Region
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Environment
environment = "production"

# Tags
tags = {
  Terraform  = "true"
  ManagedBy  = "terraform"
  Project    = "smart-s3-deploy"
  Owner      = "Your-Name"
  CostCenter = "your-cost-center"
}
```

### 4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 6. Upload Your Website Files

After the infrastructure is created, you can upload your website files to the S3 bucket using either the automated method or manually through the AWS Console.

#### Option 1: Manual Upload (Using AWS Console)

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to the S3 service
3. Find and select your bucket (e.g., `my-static-website-i91hat9g`)
4. Click "Upload"
5. Upload your website files:
   - `index.html` - Main website page
   - `error.html` - Error page
   - Any other assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
6. Set appropriate content types:
   - HTML files: `text/html`
   - CSS files: `text/css`
   - JavaScript files: `application/javascript`
   - Images: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.
7. Click "Upload" to complete the process

### 7. Access Your Website

Get your CloudFront domain name:

```bash
terraform output cloudfront_domain_name
```

Access your website using the CloudFront URL: `https://<cloudfront-domain-name>/`

## 🔧 Customization

### Modifying the S3 Bucket Configuration

Edit the `modules/s3/main.tf` file to customize the S3 bucket configuration:

- Change lifecycle rules
- Modify CORS settings
- Adjust versioning settings

### Modifying the CloudFront Distribution

Edit the `modules/cloudfront/main.tf` file to customize the CloudFront distribution:

- Change cache behaviors
- Modify TTL settings
- Add custom error responses
- Configure additional origins

## 💰 Cost Optimization

This project includes several cost optimization features:

- **S3 Lifecycle Rules**: Automatically clean up old versions and incomplete uploads
- **CloudFront Price Class**: Uses PriceClass_100 (North America and Europe only) for lower costs
- **Optimized Cache Settings**: Different TTLs for different file types to reduce origin requests

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| Service    | Usage Estimate | Monthly Cost |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| S3         | 1 GB storage   | ~$0.023      |
| CloudFront | 10 GB transfer | ~$0.85       |
| **Total**  |                | **~$0.87**   |

*Note: Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns and region.*

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- S3 bucket has public access blocked
- CloudFront uses Origin Access Identity to access S3
- Server-side encryption enabled for S3 objects
- HTTPS enforced through CloudFront

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all resources created by this project:

```bash
# Empty the S3 bucket first

# Then destroy the Terraform resources
terraform destroy
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### CloudFront Distribution Not Working

1. Check if the distribution is fully deployed (can take 10-15 minutes)
2. Verify that the S3 bucket policy allows CloudFront access
3. Create an invalidation for `/*` to refresh the cache

### S3 Website Endpoint Not Working

The S3 website endpoint is not accessible by default because public access is blocked. Use the CloudFront URL instead.
